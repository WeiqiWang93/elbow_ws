This R\+OS package provides some tools to facilitate definition of R\+OS tf transforms.

It provides two binaries\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{static\+\_\+transform\+\_\+publisher}} is an adapted version of {\ttfamily tf2\+\_\+ros}\textquotesingle{}s source code, providing more fine-\/grained command-\/line options to define orientations from an arbitrary set of Euler angles.
\item {\bfseries{static\+\_\+transform\+\_\+publisher\+\_\+gui}} is an interactive version of the {\ttfamily static\+\_\+transform\+\_\+publisher} allowing you to modify the transform interactively.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Furthermore it provides some extensions to rviz\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item An {\bfseries{Euler\+Property}} class allowing for definition of arbitrary sets of Euler angles (and conversion between them).
\item A {\bfseries{Rotation\+Property}} class combining {\ttfamily Euler\+Property} and {\ttfamily Quaternion\+Property} to provide flexible means of entering orientation information.
\item An {\bfseries{interactive transform publisher}} as an {\ttfamily rviz\+::\+Display} plugin allowing you to interactively explore your desired transform with an rviz marker. You can use this also, to interactively perform frame transformations. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
