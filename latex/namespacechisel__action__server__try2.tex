\begin{DoxyVerb}actionserver.py notes:
ArmStatus isn't finite state, it can be both deployed and stuck
execute_callback should set self.goal_id, self.text from the action msg
line 53 Feedback() doesn't exist --> I corrected by importing [ACTION]Feedback as Feedback
line 54 Result() doesn't exist --> I corrected by importing [ACTION]Result as Result
line 101 goal contains attribute action_type which has attribute type, so this should read goal.action_type.type
line 136 let's assume goal msg has an attribute 'config', and pass that into the callback
line 143 replace 'success' with 'done'
line 143 you should call a self._done which must be overwritten in the child to set 'done'
